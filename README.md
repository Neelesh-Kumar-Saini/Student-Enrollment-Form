There will be three control buttons [Save], [change] and [Reset] at the bottom of the form. On page load or any control button click, an empty form will be displayed and the cursor will remain at the first input field in the form which will have the primary key in the relation. All other fields and buttons should be disabled at this time.

User will enter data in the field having primary key and

If the primary key value does NOT exist in the database, enable [Save] and [Reset] buttons and move the cursor to the next field and allow the user to enter data in the form.

Check that the data should be valid i.e. no empty fields.
